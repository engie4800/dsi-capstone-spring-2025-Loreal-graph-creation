All members present.

2b. Was there a discussion on the work? 
We discussed the main difficulty and doubts to raise in the mentor meeting. We also attribute workload to each person. For example, mine was complete rag pipeline (include the vectors) and find existing prompts (fashion, customer reviews). 

2c. Did you have a project management component? Did you make progress? Does everyone know what to do next?
Yes, it was basically what we did during our team working meeting on Tuesday. I made progress on the vector RAG pipeline part, and I’m currently using last group’s prompt for now.

2d. Any challenges or roadblocks?
The question about the rigorousness of using LLM as judge. Proposed human evaluation of around 100-1000 evaluation samples. 

3. Any questions/feedback? 
N/A
