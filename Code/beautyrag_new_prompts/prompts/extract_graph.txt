-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-

Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:

entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized

entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]

entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:

source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1

target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1

relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other

relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use {record_delimiter} as the list delimiter.

When finished, output {completion_delimiter}
